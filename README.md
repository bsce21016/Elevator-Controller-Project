# Elevator-Controller-Project
This repository contains the hardware and software implementation for an elevator controller system. The project utilizes the STM32f407 microcontroller and is developed using the STM32CubeIDE integrated development environment.

Hardware Implementation:
The hardware implementation of the elevator controller includes the circuitry and components required to control and manage the elevator's movement. It involves connecting the STM32f407 microcontroller with various peripheral devices such as buttons, sensors, motor drivers, and displays. The hardware design, schematics, and connections are documented in this repository. The design ensures efficient and reliable operation of the elevator system.

Software Implementation:
The software implementation encompasses the firmware development for the STM32f407 microcontroller using STM32CubeIDE. The firmware controls the elevator's behavior, including floor selection, motor control, door management, and communication with peripheral devices.
